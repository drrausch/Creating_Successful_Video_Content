## Creating Successful Original Content
### First Thoughts and Hypothesis

In the recent years, the popularity of streaming services has been revolutionized by big tech companies such as YouTube, Netflix, HBO and many others. Consumer's habits have changed in response to this. Why pay for movie tickets at the theater when you can stay home and watch whatever you'd like? 

Because of this trend, we decided to look at success rates of movies and TV shows in the past years to better advise Microsoft in creating successful orginal content. To determine success, it's necessary to look at key areas of the entertainment industry - viewership, ratings, and award nominations. After researching these three areas, we've determined the best route to successful original content is by creating a TV series. 

### Question 2: Which network or streaming service would best support our series?   
#### Which network has received the most award nominations in the last four years? 

Awards shows are a great way to evaluate the success of a TV series. The Emmy's are well-known and much talked about, making this the perfect Awards show to help us determine which networks would be the best platform for success.  

After scraping shows and actors nominated for major award from the Emmy's site, it was obvious that several networks have been more successful than others over the last few years. As you can see in the chart below, HBO, Netflix and Prime Video have out-performed all other networks with clearly HBO in the lead.

#### Which networks are receiving the most independent show and actor nominations? 

Looking at the top three winningest networks, we can see that HBO not only has the highest number of show nominations, but also the most individual actor nominations. 

Of the two award nominations available, the first being a show nomination and the second an actor nomination, HBO is clearly leading the pack in both. Netflix succeeds in show nominations, but has few actor nominations. The below graph also shows that while Netflix has received many nominations for multiple shows, those shows are only nominated for a maximum of 3 awards while some HBO shows have been nominated twice that amount.

#### Finally, which network has had the most shows nominated within the last two years? 

Taking a look at the past two years, we can see that seven HBO shows, nine Netflix shows, and only two Prime Video shows have been nominated for an Emmy. One could argue that Netflix has been the most successful considering they have a higher number of shows nominated, however you can see below that the six HBO shows were nominated for a larger number of awards than the Netflix shows. This means that the six HBO shows are more successful than the nine Netflix shows.

#### We believe that HBO is the best network to host Microsoft's new original TV series.

Above, we presented three arguments that present HBO as the clear choice: 
1. From 2017-2020, HBO shows have collected more nominations than the competing networks 
2. HBO not only has the largest number of aggregate nominations, they also are more successful at both a series and actor leve 
3. While Netflix has had more shows nominated for awards in the last two years, HBO is close behind and shows a higher success rate per show than Netflix 

### Question 3: What type of show will be profitable? 
#### Insight

In todays subscription structured business models, the most important variable that determines success is viewership. Here I wanted to investigate total views by genre to detemine which genres generate the most views.

#### Which genres generate the most views? 

With this in mind, I found viewership numbers from four popular networks. From this analysis there were five genres with the most views for TV series. They are as follows:

1. Drama
2. Comedy
3. Crime
4. Action
5. Fantasy

#### Which genre should Microsoft choose for their new TV series? 

It's clear that Drama is the top genre for all four networks. Comedy, Action and Crime genres all trail close behind and could also be worth investment. 

In order to break into this industry, I would recommend developing a tv series with the genre Drama being the foundation. It's shown below that Drama drives the highest number of viewers, which will help meet demand and increase subscription numbers.

#### Future work

I would like to investigate the best combination of genres with Drama being the core element of the combination and determine which combination provides the most views.
